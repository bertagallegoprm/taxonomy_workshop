## Molecular and informatics tools for species classification

This repository contains a very simple sequences global alignment script for educational purposes (`global_align.py`). It illustrates the uses of molecular techniques and informatics for species classification.

It comes with *dummy* sequences for a set of species of mollusks,
where `x.fasta` contains the sequence from an unknown origin
and `database.fasta` contains the reference sequences.
